      "context": "D. Membrane Fluidity is Regulated\n1. Chemical Factors Affecting Membrane Fluidity\nAs you might imagine, the fluidity of a membrane depends on its chemical composition and physical conditions surrounding the cell, for example the outside temperature. Factors that affect membrane fluidity are summarized below.\nJust as heating a solution causes dissolved molecules and particulates to move faster, phospholipid and protein components of membranes are also more fluid at higher temperatures. If the fatty acids of the phospholipids have more unsaturated (C=C) carbon bonds, these hydrophobic tails will have more kinks, or bends. The kinks tend to push apart the phospholipid tails. With more space between the fatty acid tails, membrane components can move more freely. Thus, more polyunsaturated fatty acids in a membrane make it more fluid. On the other hand, cholesterol molecules tend to fill the space between fatty acids in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. This reduces the lateral mobility of phospholipid and protein components in the membrane. By reducing fluidity, cholesterol reduces membrane permeability to some ions.\n2. Functional Factors Affecting Membrane Fluidity\nEvolution has adapted cell membranes to different and changing environments to maintain the fluidity necessary for proper cell function. Poikilothermic, or coldblooded organisms, from prokaryotes to fish and reptiles, do not regulate their body temperatures. Thus, when exposed to lower temperatures, poikilotherms respond by increasing the unsaturated fatty acid content of their cell membranes. At higher temperatures, they increase membrane saturated fatty acid content. Thus, the cell membranes of fish living under the arctic ice maintain fluidity by having high levels of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. What about fish species that range across warmer and colder environments (or that live in climates with changing seasons). For these fish, membrane composition can change to adjust fluidity to environment.\nThe warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammals and birds maintain a more or less constant body temperature. As a result, their membrane composition is also relatively constant. But there is a paradox! Their cell membranes are very fluid, with a higher ratio of polyunsaturated fat to monounsaturated fats than say, reptiles. The apparent paradox is resolved however, when we understand that this greater fluidity supports the higher metabolic rate of the warm-blooded species compared to poikilotherms. Just compare the life styles of almost any mammal to a lazy floating alligator, or a snake basking in the shade of a rock!\n284 Factors Influencing Membrane Fluidity\nE.

      "answer": "The function of the red blood cell protein glycophorin A is to prevent red blood cells from aggregating, or clumping in the circulation.",
      "context": "16.4: How Membrane Proteins are Held in Membranes\nThe hydrophobic domain of integral membrane proteins consists of one or more alphahelical regions that interact with the hydrophobic interior of the membranes. Hydrophilic domains tend to have more tertiary structure with hydrophilic surfaces, and so face the aqueous cytosol and cell exterior. Two trans-membrane proteins are cartooned below.\nThe protein on the left crosses the membrane once, while the one on the right crosses the membrane three times. How a transmembrane protein inserts into the membrane during synthesis dictates the locations of its N- and C-terminus. Transmembrane proteins can in fact cross a membrane more than once, which also determines the location of its N- and C-termini. N-terminal end of a plasma membrane polypeptide always ends up exposed to the outside of the cell. The alpha helical domains that anchor proteins in membranes are mostly non-polar and hydrophobic themselves. As an example, consider the amino acids in the alpha- helical domain of the red blood cell protein glycophorin A, a membrane protein that prevents red blood cells from aggregating, or clumping in the circulation. One glycophorin A polypeptide with its hydrophobic trans-membrane alpha helix is cartooned below. Glycophorin A monomers pair to form dimers in the plasma membrane.\nProteins that span membranes multiple times may include amino acids with charged, polar side chains, provided that these side chains interact between helices so that they are shielded from the fatty acid environment in the membrane. Because of these hydrophilic interactions, such proteins can create pores for the transport of polar molecules and ions; we will see some of these proteins later. Integral membrane proteins that do not span the membrane also have a hydrophobic helical domain that anchors them in the membrane, while their hydrophilic domains typically interact with intracellular or extracellular molecules to e.g., hold cells in place give cells and tissues their structure, etc.\nThe very presence of the hydrophobic alpha-helical domains in trans-membrane proteins makes them difficult if not impossible to isolate from membranes in a biologically active form. By contrast, the peripheral polypeptide cytochrome c readily dissociates from the cristal membrane, making it easy to purify. For many years, an inability to purify other cristal membrane electron carriers in biologically active form limited our understanding of the structure and function of the mitochondrial electron transport system.\nHydrophobic alpha-helical domains are in fact, a hallmark of membrane-spanning proteins. It is even possible to determine the primary structure of a polypeptide encoded by a gene before the protein itself has been isolated. For example, knowing the DNA sequence of a gene, we can infer the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene. A hydrophobicity analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence can tell us if a protein is likely to be a membrane protein. Let\u2019s look at a hydropathy (hydrophobicity) plot (below).\n"

Oligosaccharides are typically linked to proteins via the hydroxyl group on serine or threonine.

In a third experiment, proteins were extracted from plasma membranes isolated from untreated cells. Electrophoretic separation of the three protein extracts by size demonstrated that different components of integral membrane proteins were present in the two digest experiments, confirming the asymmetry of the plasma membrane. Again, for more details, check the link below.\n282 Electrophoretic Demonstration of Membrane Asymmetry\nThe idea that membranes are fluid was also tested. In yet another elegant experiment, antibodies were made to mouse and human cell membrane proteins. Membranes were isolated and injected into a third animal (a rabbit most likely). The rabbit saw the membranes and their associated proteins as foreign and responded by making specific anti-membrane antibody molecules. The antibodies against each membrane source were isolated and separately tagged with different colored fluorescent labels so that they would glow a different color when subjected to ultraviolet light. After mouse and human cells were mixed under conditions that caused them to fuse, making human-mouse hybrid cells. When added to fused cells, the tagged antibodies bound to the cell surface proteins. After a short time, the different fluorescent antibodies were seen to mix under a fluorescence microscope under UV light. The fluorescent tags seemed to moving from their original location in the fused membranes. Clearly, proteins embedded in the membrane are not static, but are able to move laterally in the membrane, in effect floating and diffusing in a \u201csea of phospholipids\u201d. The mouse antibodies as seen in the hybrid cell right after fusion are cartooned below.\n283 Two Demonstrations of Membrane Fluidity: The Fluid Mosaic\n"

      "answer": "The hydrophobic alpha-helical domains in trans-membrane proteins anchor the proteins in the membrane.",
      "context": "16.4: How Membrane Proteins are Held in Membranes\nThe hydrophobic domain of integral membrane proteins consists of one or more alphahelical regions that interact with the hydrophobic interior of the membranes. Hydrophilic domains tend to have more tertiary structure with hydrophilic surfaces, and so face the aqueous cytosol and cell exterior. Two trans-membrane proteins are cartooned below.\nThe protein on the left crosses the membrane once, while the one on the right crosses the membrane three times. How a transmembrane protein inserts into the membrane during synthesis dictates the locations of its N- and C-terminus. Transmembrane proteins can in fact cross a membrane more than once, which also determines the location of its N- and C-termini. N-terminal end of a plasma membrane polypeptide always ends up exposed to the outside of the cell. The alpha helical domains that anchor proteins in membranes are mostly non-polar and hydrophobic themselves. As an example, consider the amino acids in the alpha- helical domain of the red blood cell protein glycophorin A, a membrane protein that prevents red blood cells from aggregating, or clumping in the circulation. One glycophorin A polypeptide with its hydrophobic trans-membrane alpha helix is cartooned below. Glycophorin A monomers pair to form dimers in the plasma membrane.\nProteins that span membranes multiple times may include amino acids with charged, polar side chains, provided that these side chains interact between helices so that they are shielded from the fatty acid environment in the membrane. Because of these hydrophilic interactions, such proteins can create pores for the transport of polar molecules and ions; we will see some of these proteins later. Integral membrane proteins that do not span the membrane also have a hydrophobic helical domain that anchors them in the membrane, while their hydrophilic domains typically interact with intracellular or extracellular molecules to e.g., hold cells in place give cells and tissues their structure, etc.\nThe very presence of the hydrophobic alpha-helical domains in trans-membrane proteins makes them difficult if not impossible to isolate from membranes in a biologically active form. By contrast, the peripheral polypeptide cytochrome c readily dissociates from the cristal membrane, making it easy to purify. For many years, an inability to purify other cristal membrane electron carriers in biologically active form limited our understanding of the structure and function of the mitochondrial electron transport system.\nHydrophobic alpha-helical domains are in fact, a hallmark of membrane-spanning proteins. It is even possible to determine the primary structure of a polypeptide encoded by a gene before the protein itself has been isolated. For example, knowing the DNA sequence of a gene, we can infer the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene. A hydrophobicity analysis of the inferred amino acid sequence can tell us if a protein is likely to be a membrane protein. Let\u2019s look at a hydropathy (hydrophobicity) plot (below).\n"

      "answer": "A mismatch between donor and recipient blood groups during a blood transfusion can be devastating, causing the red cells to clump, restricting blood flow and ultimately killing the transfusion recipient. This occurs due to the interaction of the red cell antigens of one blood group with antibodies in another blood group.",
      "context": "16.8: Glycoproteins and Human Health\nWe\u2019ll close this chapter with a few examples of glycoproteins that play crucial roles in human physiology. Let\u2019s look first at the major human blood groups. The major A, B, AB, O and Rh blood groups result from the presence or absence of glycoprotein antigens embedded in red blood cell membranes and the presence or absence in the blood, of antibodies against the antigens. Typically, exposure to antigens (foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, toxins\u2026) generates immunoglobulins, the antibody molecules of our immune system; immunoglobulins are glycoproteins. The situation with blood groups is something of a paradox. The blood group antibodies already in the blood of a healthy person are not a response to foreign antigen invasion\nYou probably know that these blood groups must be compatible for a successful blood transfusion. A mismatch between donor and recipient can be devastating. The interaction of the red cell antigens of one blood group with antibodies in another blood group will cause the red cells to clump, restricting blood flow and ultimately killing the transfusion recipient. The table below summarizes why transfusions with mismatched A, B, AB, O blood groups must be avoided.\nGroup A Group B Group AB Group O\nCell-surface antigens\nAntibodies inthe blood None\nAcceptable donor-recipient\nmatches\nGroup A or Group O donors\nGroup B or Group O donors\nUniversal Recipient (Group AB, A, B, O donors)\nOnly Group O donors\nWhy red cells clump in\nmismatched blood\nAnti-A from Group B donor binds, aggregates recipient red cells; recipient Anti B binds, aggregated donor red cells\nAnti-B from Group A donor binds, aggregates recipient red cells; recipient Anti A binds, aggregates donor red cells\nAntibodies in Group O blood will bind any donor red cell antigens and cause the cells to clump\nAnother red blood cell antigen is the Rh factor. People have either it (Rh+ ) or not (Rh- ). In contrast, when an Rhrecipient receives blood from an Rh+ donor, the recipient\u2019s immune system makes defensive anti-Rh antibodies in the usual way. This too can cause blood cell clumping with bad consequences. A word to the wise: it\u2019s a good idea to know your own blood group!\nCheck the Red Cross website (here) or Wikipedia for more detail about blood groups.\nThe last example here involves the cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins that distinguish self from non-self in body tissues and organs. Major organ Transplantation (liver, kidneys, heart) from donors into patients with failing organs has become, if not routine, then at least increasingly common. Before a transplant, MHC tissue typing determines donor and recipient compatibility, reducing the chances of the rejection of the transplanted organ. Since available donors are few, and good matches even fewer, patients wait on prioritized lists for a matched organ. Even when MHC typing is a match for a patient, the immune systems of transplant recipients are suppressed with hormones to reduce further the chance of rejection. Unlike the limited number of blood groups, many MHC proteins are analyzed to determine a match. Thus, it is not practical (or routinely necessary) to \u2018know\u2019 your MHC type! In the next chapter, we look at membrane functions intrinsic to cellular existence itself.\n"

      "context": "Liposome membrane structure is consistent with the predicted phospholipid bilayer, with the hydrophobic tails interacting with each other and the polar heads facing away from each other, forming a phospholipid bilayer. This led to a picture of membrane architecture based on phospholipid interactions. An iconic illustration of the phospholipid bilayer, with its hydrophobic fatty acid interior and hydrophilic external surfaces is drawn below.\nB. Models of Membrane Structure\nIn 1935, Davson and Danielli suggested that proteins might be bound to the polar heads of the phospholipids in the plasma membrane, creating a protein/lipid/protein sandwich. Decades later, J.D. Robertson observed membranes in the transmission electron microscope at high power, revealing that all cellular membranes had a trilamellar structure. The classic trilamellar appearance of a cellular membrane in the electron microscope is illustrated below\nThe trilamellar structure is consistent with the protein-coated hydrophilic surfaces of a phospholipid bilayer in Davson and Danielli\u2019s protein-lipid-protein sandwich. Observing that all cellular membranes had this trilamellar structure, Robertson he further proposed his Unit Membrane model: all membranes consist of a clear phospholipid bilayer coated with electron-dense proteins.\nThe static view of the trilamellar models of membrane structure implied by the Davson-Danielli or Robertson models was replaced in 1972 by Singer and Nicolson\u2019s Fluid Mosaic model (see The fluid mosaic model of membranes. Science 175:720- 731). They suggested that in addition to peripheral proteins that do bind to the surfaces of membranes, many integral membrane proteins actually span the membrane. Integral membrane proteins were imagined as a mosaic of protein \u2018tiles\u2019 embedded in a phospholipid medium. But unlike a mosaic of glazed tiles set in a firm, cement-like structure, the protein \u2018tiles\u2019 were predicted to be mobile (fluid) in a phospholipid sea. In this model, membrane proteins are anchored in membranes by one or more hydrophobic domains;\n"

      "answer": "Cytoskeletal elements create and maintain micro-discontinuities in cellular membranes, immobilizing integral membrane proteins if they are attached to cytoskeletal fibers, and when aggregates of these proteins line up due to similar interactions, they form a kind of fence, inhibiting other membrane components from crossing.",
      "context": "Micelles can further self-assemble into spherical phospholipid bilayers called liposomes (below).\nWhen formed in the laboratory, these structures behave somewhat like cells, for example, forming a pellet at the bottom of a tube when centrifuged. Liposomes can be custom designed from different kinds of phospholipids and amphipathic proteins that become integral to the liposome membranes. When liposomes can be prepared in the presence of specific proteins or other molecules that can\u2019t cross the membrane. The trapped molecules cannot get out of this synthetic \u2018organelle\u2019. Such were the studies that allowed the identification of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The ability to manipulate liposome content and membrane composition also make them candidates for the drug delivery to specific cells and tissues (google liposome for more information).\nF. The Plasma Membrane is Segragated into Regions with Different Properties of Fluidity and Selective Permeability\nAs we will see shortly, fluidity does not result in an equal diffusion of all membrane components around the cell membrane surface. Instead, extracellular connections between cells as well as intracellular connections of the membrane to differentiated regions of the cytoskeleton, effectively compartmentalize the membrane into subregions. To understand this, imagine a sheet of epithelial like those in the cartoon below.\nThe sheet of cells exposes one surface with unique functions to the inside of the organ they line. It exposes the opposite surface, one with a quite different function, to the other side of the sheet. The lateral surfaces of the cells are yet another membrane compartment, one that functions to connect and communicate between the cells in the sheet. Components, i.e., membrane proteins illustrated with different symbolic shapes and colors, may remain fluid within a compartment. Of course, this macrodifferentiation of cell membranes to permit cell-cell and cell-environmental interactions makes intuitive sense.\nThe recent observation that cellular membranes are even more compartmentalized was perhaps less anticipated. In fact, membranes are further divided into microcompartments. Within these compartments, components are fluid but seldom move between compartments. Studies indicate that cytoskeletal elements create and maintain these micro-discontinuities. For example, integral membrane proteins are immobilized in membranes if they are attached to cytoskeletal fibers (e.g., actin) in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, when aggregates of these proteins line up due to similar interactions, they form kind of fence, inhibiting other membrane components from crossing. By analogy, this mechanism of micro-compartmentalization is called the Fences and Pickets\n"

      "answer": "The different proteins and to some extent, different phospholipids, structurally and functionally differentiate one kind of cellular membrane from another.",
      "context": "16.1: Overview\nThe plasma membrane has the same phospholipid bilayer construction as all intracellular membranes. All membranes are a fluid mosaic of proteins attached to or embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. The different proteins and to some extent, different phospholipids, structurally and functionally differentiate one kind of cellular membrane from another. Integral (trans-membrane) proteins span the phospholipid lipid bilayer, with one hydrophobic domain and two hydrophilic domains. In the case of the plasma membrane, the hydrophilic domains interact with the aqueous extracellular fluid on one side and the cytoplasm on the other, while the hydrophobic domain keeps the proteins anchored in the membrane. Once embedded in the fatty acid interior of a membrane, integral membrane proteins cannot escape! In contrast, peripheral membrane proteins bind to membrane surfaces, typically held in place by hydrophilic interactions with charged features of the membrane surface (phospholipid heads, hydrophilic surface domains of integral proteins). Integral membrane proteins are often glycoproteins whose sugars face the outside of the cell. Cells thus present a sugar coating, or glycocalyx, to the outside world. As cells form tissues and organs, they become bound to extracellular proteins and glycoproteins that they, or other cells, secrete to form an extracellular matrix. We will spend much of this chapter looking at characteristic structures and biological activities of plasma membrane proteins and their functions.\nWhen you have mastered the information in this chapter, you should be able to:\n1. distinguish components of the membrane that can move (diffuse) laterally in the membrane from those that can flip (switch)\nfrom the outer to the inner surface of the phospholipid bilayer\n2. compare the fluid mosaic membrane to earlier membrane models and cite the evidence for and against each (as\nappropriate).\n3. describe how cells might make their plasma membranes and suggest an experiment that would demonstrate your\nhypothesis.\n4. distinguish between transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins, and provide specific examples of each. 5. decide whether a newly discovered protein might be a membrane protein. 6. predict the effect of molecular and physical influences on membrane fluidity 7. suggest how organisms living in warm tropical waters have adapted to the higher temperatures.
