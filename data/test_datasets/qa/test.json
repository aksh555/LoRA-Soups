      "context": " 9Reckless AttackStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.Danger SenseAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren\u2019t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can\u2019t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.Primal PathAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.Ability Score ImprovementWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren\u2019t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.Brutal CriticalBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.Relentless RageStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you\u2019re raging and don\u2019t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.Persistent RageBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.Indomitable MightBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.Primal ChampionAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.Path of the BerserkerFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end\u2014 that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker\u2019s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-\u00ad\u2010\u2011being.Frenzy Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-\u00ad\u2010\u2011A)."

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.Spell Slots The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level and a 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know four 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.Way of the Open HandMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.Open Hand Technique Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy\u2019s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\u2022 It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or beknocked prone.\u2022 It must make a Strength saving throw.

For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven\u2019t already taken a bonus action this turn.\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself.

Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

      "context": "Hill Dwarf As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\nElf Elf Traits\nYour elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-\u00ad\u2010\u2011 expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others\u2019 freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill. Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can\u2019t put you to sleep. Trance. Elves don\u2019t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \u201ctrance.\u201d) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\nHigh Elf As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-\u00ad\u2010\u2011elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. Cantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.\nHalfling Halfling Traits\nYour halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings. Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century. Alignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-\u00ad\u2010\u2011hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways. Size. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\nLucky. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\nBrave. You have advantage on saving throws\nagainst being frightened.\n"

For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven\u2019t already taken a bonus action this turn.\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature\u2019s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nFlurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nMonastic Tradition\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, such as the Way of the Open Hand. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSlow Fall\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n"

      "answer": "The formula for calculating the Spell save DC for a cleric spell is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.",
      "context": "Preparing and Casting Spells The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level cleric, you have four 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level and two 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level or 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u2019t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain\nChoose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods\nassociated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells Each domain has a list of spells\u2014its domain spells\u2014 that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn\u2019t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn\u2019t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n"

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level and a 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know four 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus You can use a musical instrument (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nBardic Inspiration\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn\u2019t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice, such as the College of Lore. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\n"

      "context": "Reckless Attack\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\nDanger Sense\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren\u2019t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can\u2019t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\nPrimal Path\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can\u2019t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFast Movement\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren\u2019t wearing heavy armor.\nFeral Instinct\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren\u2019t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\nBrutal Critical\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\nRelentless Rage\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you\u2019re raging and don\u2019t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\nPersistent Rage\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\nIndomitable Might\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\nPrimal Champion\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\nPath of the Berserker\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end\u2014 that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker\u2019s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-\u00ad\u2010\u2011being.\nFrenzy Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix PH-\u00ad\u2010\u2011A).\n"

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level druid, you have four 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level and two 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slots.

Casting the spell doesn\u2019t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.

In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u2019t have a flying or swimming speed.\nBeast Shapes\nLevel\nMax.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\u2022 Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics\nof the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u2019t use them.\n\u2022 When you transform, you assume the beast\u2019s hit\npoints and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods\u2019 tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels\u2014the perfect servants of good\u2014as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. Honesty. Don\u2019t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise. Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nOath of Devotion Spells\nPaladin Level Spells\n3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary\n5th lesser restoration, zone of truth\n9th beacon of hope, dispel magic\n13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith\n17th commune, flame strike\nChannel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-\u00ad\u2010\u2011foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u2019t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-\u00ad\u2010\u2011foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution\nfrom a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-\u00ad\u2010 night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast\n"

You can perform the somatic and verbal\ncomponents of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren\u2019t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren\u2019t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nCircle of the Land\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle\u2019s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can\u2019t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level slot or two 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level slots.\nCircle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land\u2014arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp\u2014and consult the associated list of spells.\n"

When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes\nits attack against you.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects,\nsuch as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here\nhave chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n"

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level paladin, you have four 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level and two 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level or a 2nd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011 level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u2019t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +\nyour Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +\nyour Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Smite\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon\u2019s damage.

They hold angels\u2014the perfect servants of good\u2014as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. Honesty. Don\u2019t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise. Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nOath of Devotion Spells\nPaladin Level Spells\n3rd protection from evil and good, sanctuary\n5th lesser restoration, zone of truth\n9th beacon of hope, dispel magic\n13th freedom of movement, guardian of faith\n17th commune, flame strike\nChannel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-\u00ad\u2010\u2011foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u2019t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u2019t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there\u2019s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can\u2019t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-\u00ad\u2010\u2011foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. Once you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution\nfrom a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-\u00ad\u2010 night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast\n"

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic.

Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Age. Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years. Alignment. Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-\u00ad\u2010\u2011hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.\nRock Gnome As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes.\nAbility Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Artificer\u2019s Lore. Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply. Tinker. You have proficiency with artisan\u2019s tools (tinker\u2019s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:\nClockwork Toy. This toy is a clockwork animal,\nmonster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\nFire Starter. The device produces a miniature flame,\nwhich you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\nMusic Box. When opened, this music box plays a\nsingle song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song\u2019s end or when it is closed.\nHalf-Elf Half-Elf Traits\nYour half-\u00ad\u2010\u2011elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-\u00ad\u2010\u2011elves.

Half-\u00ad\u2010\u2011elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years. Alignment. Half-\u00ad\u2010\u2011elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers.

You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.\nEmpty Body\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can\u2019t take any other creatures with you.\nPerfect Self\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.\nMonastic Traditions Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.\nWay of the Open Hand\nMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\nOpen Hand Technique Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy\u2019s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\n\u2022 It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be\nknocked prone.\n\u2022 It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails,\nyou can push it up to 15 feet away from you.\n\u2022 It can\u2019t take reactions until the end of your next\nturn.\nWholeness of Body At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three\n"
